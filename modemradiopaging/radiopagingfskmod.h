// 2-level and 4-level FSK modulator of the paging protocols.
//
// Symbols are levels from -1 to +1 (+1 = outer symbol, positive deviation), queued in blocks
// of one baud rate, so a FLEX frame can change rate between its sync and data parts. The
// chain runs at an internal rate of 38400 Hz, where every paging rate has a whole number of
// samples per symbol (512: 75, 600: 64, 1200: 32, 1600: 24, 2400: 16, 3200: 12):
//   NRZ level      held for the samples of its symbol
//   shaping        Gaussian low pass on the NRZ level, unity DC gain: symbol runs reach the
//                  deviation exactly and the deviation is never exceeded. Its 3 dB cutoff is
//                  in Hz, so one filter serves all rates of a protocol (FLEX: 3.2 kHz, the
//                  STD-43A 2.1.9 baseband filter). It also sets the occupied bandwidth
//   resampling     Interpolator from 38400 Hz to the channel sample rate, on the shaped level
//   FM             phase accumulator at the channel sample rate, scaled to the deviation of
//                  the outer symbol: the frequency is exact at any resampling ratio
// The output is unit amplitude complex baseband at the channel sample rate.
