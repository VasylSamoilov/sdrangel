// One encoder per polarity holds its queue, placement and message numbers. A transmission starts with the emergency
// re-synchronization (3.2.1), at least a battery saving cycle of the collapse long and
// ending on a frame boundary of the time grid, then frames one after the other, each with
// the cycle and frame number of its time. A frame is in the network polarity; it goes to
// the other polarity when that one has a message due in the frame and the network has no

// shifted by half), so it serves both polarities. Each frame carries the messages due in
// it (their capcode listens to it): priority addresses first, then the others, tone only
// last, oldest first; a message that does not fit waits for its next frame.
